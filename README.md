> A typeahead/autocomplete component for React

react-typeahead is a javascript library that provides a react-based
typeahead, or autocomplete text entry, as well as a "typeahead tokenizer",
a typeahead that allows you to select multiple results.

## Usage

For a typeahead input:

```javascript
var Typeahead = require('react-typeahead').Typeahead;
React.render(Typeahead({
  options: ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'],
  maxVisible: 2
}));
```

For a tokenizer typeahead input:

```javascript
var Tokenizer = require('react-typeahead').Tokenizer;
React.render(Tokenizer({
  options: ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'],
  onTokenAdd: function(token) {
    console.log('token added: ', token);
  }
}));
```

## Developing

### Setting Up

You will need `npm` to develop on react-typeahead.  [Installing npm][4].

Once that's done, to get started, run `npm install` in your checkout directory.
This will install all the local development dependences, such as `gulp` and `mocha`

### Testing

react-typeahead uses mocha for unit tests and gulp for running them.  Large changes should
include unittests.

After updating or creating new tests, run `npm run-script build-test` to regenerate the
test package.

Once that's done, running the tests is easy with `gulp`:

```
> gulp test
[00:17:25] Using gulpfile ~/src/react-typeahead/gulpfile.js
[00:17:25] Starting 'test'...

  
  ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․

  15 passing (43ms)

[00:17:25] Finished 'test' after 448 ms
[00:17:25] Starting 'default'...
[00:17:25] Finished 'default' after 6.23 μs
```

### Contributing

Basically, fork the repository and send a pull request.  It can be difficult to review these, so
here are some general rules to follow for getting your PR accepted more quickly:

- Break your changes into smaller, easy to understand commits.
- Send separate PRs for each commit when possible.
- Feel free to rebase, merge, and rewrite commits to make them more readible.
- Add comments explaining anything that's not painfully obvious.
- Add unittests for your change if possible.
